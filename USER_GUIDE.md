## Tips & Best Practices

### Getting Started

#### First-Time Setup
1. ✅ **Enable notifications** first for reminder functionality
2. ✅ **Create tags** for your main categories (Work, Personal, etc.)
3. ✅ **Set up templates** for recurring tasks
4. ✅ **Explore filters** to understand organization options
5. ✅ **Test export** to understand backup process

#### Learn the Basics
- Start with simple todos (title only)
- Add due dates as you get comfortable
- Experiment with priorities
- Try creating one subtask
- Practice editing and deleting

### Productivity Tips

#### Priority Management
- 🎯 Use **High priority sparingly** for truly urgent items
- 🎯 Reserve 3-5 slots for high priority at most
- 🎯 Most todos should be **Medium** (80%)
- 🎯 Use **Low** for "someday/maybe" tasks
- 🎯 Review priorities weekly

#### Time Management
- ⏰ Set **reminders** for time-sensitive todos
- ⏰ Review **Overdue** section daily (preferably morning)
- ⏰ Use **date ranges** in filters for weekly planning
- ⏰ Schedule **recurring todos** for habits
- ⏰ Check **calendar view** for weekly overview

#### Task Breakdown
- 📋 Break complex tasks into **subtasks**
- 📋 Aim for subtasks under 30 minutes each
- 📋 Use **progress bar** to track advancement
- 📋 Complete subtasks incrementally
- 📋 Celebrate when progress bar reaches 100%

#### Organization Strategies
- 🗂️ **Combine tags and priorities** for better organization
- 🗂️ Create tag hierarchy (Work → Project → Client)
- 🗂️ Use **recurring todos** for habits and routines
- 🗂️ Set up **saved filter presets** for daily workflows
- 🗂️ Review **Completed** section weekly for insights

### Workflow Examples

#### Daily Workflow
```
Morning:
1. Check Overdue section
2. Apply "Today High Priority" filter preset
3. Review calendar view
4. Complete 3 high-priority items

Afternoon:
5. Add new todos as they come up
6. Update subtask progress
7. Check upcoming reminders

Evening:
8. Review completed items
9. Plan tomorrow's priorities
10. Export JSON backup (weekly)
```

#### Weekly Workflow
```
Monday:
1. Review last week's completed todos
2. Clear old completed items
3. Apply "This Week" filter preset
4. Set priorities for the week
5. Create recurring todos

Friday:
6. Complete week review
7. Export CSV for analysis
8. Archive completed todos
9. Prepare next week's templates
10. Backup JSON export
```

### Data Management

#### Backup Strategy
- 💾 **Export JSON weekly** (minimum)
- 💾 Store backups in cloud (Dropbox, Drive, OneDrive)
- 💾 Keep last 4 weeks of backups
- 💾 Archive monthly (compress old backups)
- 💾 Test import occasionally to verify backups work

#### Cleanup Routine
- 🧹 **Weekly**: Delete old completed todos (> 7 days)
- 🧹 **Monthly**: Review and delete unused templates
- 🧹 **Monthly**: Consolidate similar tags
- 🧹 **Quarterly**: Archive old data via export
- 🧹 **Yearly**: Start fresh or major cleanup

#### Template Management
- 📝 Create templates for tasks you do 3+ times
- 📝 Include category for better organization
- 📝 Review templates monthly
- 📝 Delete unused templates
- 📝 Update templates as processes change

### Filter Preset Ideas

#### Productivity Presets
```
"Today's Focus"
- Priority: High
- Completion: Incomplete
- Date: Today

"This Week Work"
- Tag: Work
- Completion: Incomplete
- Date: This week

"Quick Wins"
- Priority: Low
- Completion: Incomplete
- (No subtasks or few subtasks)

"Overdue Critical"
- Priority: High
- Tag: Work
- (Manually check Overdue section)
```

#### Review Presets
```
"Completed This Week"
- Completion: Completed
- Date: Past 7 days

"Personal Progress"
- Tag: Personal
- Completion: All
- Date: This month

"Work Deliverables"
- Tag: Work
- Priority: High
- Completion: All
```
